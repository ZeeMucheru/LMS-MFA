A Learning Management System (LMS) is a software platform designed to deliver, manage, and track educational content and training programs. It serves as a centralized hub where instructors can create and organize learning materials, administer assessments, monitor learner progress, and facilitate communication with students.

The LMS supports various learning formats including videos, quizzes, assignments, live classes, and discussion forums. Students can access course materials anytime, from any location, allowing for flexible and self-paced learning. Built-in analytics tools provide real-time insights into learner engagement and performance, enabling educators to tailor content and support based on individual needs.

Modern LMS platforms often include features such as:

User and role management (students, instructors, admins),

Grading and feedback tools,

Progress tracking and certification,

Discussion boards and messaging,

Mobile accessibility, and

Integration with third-party tools (e.g., video conferencing, plagiarism checkers, content libraries).

Used in universities, corporate training, and professional development programs, an LMS enhances the learning experience by making education more accessible, personalized, and efficient.
